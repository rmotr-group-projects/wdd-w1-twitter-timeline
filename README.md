# Twitter Timeline

For this project we'll have to extend our previous Twitter clone to include the "following" and "timeline" features. You'll also need to write a data migration to change the way we used to store our tweets. For that, check the `tests/test_models.py` test case.

## Follow/Unfollow 

When we're browsing some user's feed, we'll need to see a _follow/unfollow_ button (check screenshots below).

## Timeline

For this project, when we browse our home page (`/`), we'll need to see a timeline of tweets constructed by our tweets and all the tweets from those users we're following, sorted historically.
